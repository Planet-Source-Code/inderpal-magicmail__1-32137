			MagicMail is an simple anonymous mailer. You can use it to send email without logging into an account. It uses the Winsock control in VB. So you need Mswinsck.ocx to be in your system directory. I have included the source code for it. It uses SMTP relaying to send the message to any e-mail address from any email address. I am also including lists of SMTP servers. If you manually edit the server list, each entry should be in the format "servername","port".
